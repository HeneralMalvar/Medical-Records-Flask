He reports episodes of falling during basketball games over the past few weeks, without loss of consciousness, seizure-like activity, or known injury. He denies dizziness or palpitations preceding the falls.

He endorses decreased appetite and reports progressive difficulty answering both simple and complex questions at school, leading to academic decline. During the interview, he was observed to have delayed responses and difficulty providing coherent details.

The patient expresses concern that he may have osteoporosis, despite reassurance that this condition is rare in his age group. He denies hallucinations or delusions but appears preoccupied with somatic concerns. No history of substance use reported.

Psychosocial history is significant for a broken family environment and long-standing exposure to abuse (social, physical, and mental). These experiences appear to have contributed to chronic stress, poor self-esteem, and social withdrawal.
